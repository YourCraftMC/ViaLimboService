## Usage

This is a [LimboService](https://github.com/YourCraftMC/LimboService) plugin, you need to install it on your LimboService server.

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/YourCraftMC/ViaLimboService/releases/latest).
2. Place the downloaded JAR file into the `plugins` folder of your LimboService server.
3. Restart your LimboService server to load the plugin.

## Note

Currently, this plugin may output some errors like:
```console
[XX:XX:XX Error] ... Thread-0 ERROR Unrecognized format specifier [ip_redactor]
[XX:XX:XX Error] ... Thread-0 ERROR Unrecognized conversion specifier [ip_redactor] starting at position 27 in conversion pattern.
[XX:XX:XX Error] ... Thread-0 ERROR Unrecognized format specifier [ip_redactor]
[XX:XX:XX Error] ... Thread-0 ERROR Unrecognized conversion specifier [ip_redactor] starting at position 67 in conversion pattern.
[XX:XX:XX Error] ... Thread-0 ERROR Unrecognized format specifier [ip_redactor]
[XX:XX:XX Error] ... Thread-0 ERROR Unrecognized conversion specifier [ip_redactor] starting at position 64 in conversion pattern.
[XX:XX:XX Error] ... Thread-0 WARN The use of package scanning to locate Log4j plugins is deprecated.
Please remove the deprecated `PluginManager.addPackage()` method call from `net.raphimc.viaproxy.util.logging.Logger.<clinit>(Logger.java:35)`.
See https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/faq.html#package-scanning for details.
```
This is caused by the ViaProxy's Log4j2 configuration, 
which is not compatible with the ViaLimboService's Log4j2 configuration,
but it does not affect the functionality of the plugin, **just ignore it**.
